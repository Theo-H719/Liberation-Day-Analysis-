# Liberation-Day-Analysis-
The "Liberation Day" Divergence Analysis of the 2025–2027 U.S. 
Project Overview -  Reciprocal Tariff Regime

This project replicates the market shock of April 2, 2025 "Liberation Day", when the U.S. administration implemented Executive Order 14257. Unlike previous sector-specific hikes (e.g., May 2024), these tariffs introduced a 10% universal baseline coupled with "Reciprocal Rates" (up to 54% for China) based on bilateral trade deficits.

Using Python-based event study methodology and predictive modeling based on Yale Budget Lab research, this project explores how these policies triggered a K-shaped decoupling between trade-dependent e-commerce and domestic industrial manufacturing.

Methodology
 
The analysis is divided into two phases:
1. Event Study (Historical):Analyzing the Cumulative Abnormal Returns (CAR) of five key sectors during the "Liberation Day" announcement window (April 2–10, 2025).
   
2. Structural Forecast (Predictive): A 2-year projection (2026–2027) using a Substitution & Pass-through Model. This model accounts for

- :The De Minimis Shock: The closure of the $800 duty-free loophole (EO 14256).
  
- Price Pass-through: The 61–80% transmission of border costs to consumer retail prices.
  
- Substitution Elasticity: The 18-month lag required for firms to relocate supply chains.
 
Core Findings

1. The Death of "Cheap Shipping" (E-Commerce)The end of the de minimis exemption on August 29, 2025, fundamentally broke the business model for direct-from-China retail.
- Finding: E-commerce stocks (ONLN) underperformed the S&P 500 by 4.2% within 7 days of the announcement.
- Thesis: The 2025 tariffs ended the "Direct-to-Consumer" era of global trade, forcing a shift back to traditional bulk warehousing.
2. The Manufacturing "K-Shaped" Recovery
While the broad economy faced a 0.6pp GDP drag, specific domestic sectors thrived.
- Finding: U.S. manufacturing output is projected to expand by 2.7% – 3.2% by 2027.
- Thesis: Protectionism successfully "onshores" production but "crowds out" other sectors like construction (-3.8%) and agriculture (-0.7%) due to higher input costs.
3. The Consumer "Tax" Reality
The "Liberation Day" tariffs function as a regressive consumption tax.
- Finding: The average U.S. household lost $3,800 in annual purchasing power by 2026.
- Thesis: High pass-through rates (reaching 24% for applied tariffs by October 2025) confirm that U.S. consumers, not foreign firms, absorb the majority of the tariff burden.

The findings can be run on python, which visualises the aftermatch of the "Liberation Day" tarriffs and thereby predict the 2026 and 2027 recovery trend.
